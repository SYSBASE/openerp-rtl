        This is an Openerp patch to fix issues occured when dealing with Arabic and RTL languages (Arabic, Hebrew, Ordo, Farsi, etc). 


    Installation on Windows: 
    ------------------------

        - copy file "arabic_reshaper.py" into:
        <INSTALL_DIR>\Openerp Server 6.1\Server\server,  where <INSTALL_DIR> is the location where you installed Openerp Server (e.g. C:\Program Files).

        - copy folder "bidi" into the same Location you put "arabic_reshaper.py" to it:
        <INSTALL_DIR>\Openerp Server 6.1\Server\server

        - copy file "textobject.py" into:
        <INSTALL_DIR>\Openerp Server 6.1\Server\server\reportlab\pdfgen, you may want to backup the old "textobject.py" before replace it with this version.

        Creating Custom Fonts Hosting Directory:
        ----------------------------------------
        	- create a new directory name "fonts" inside:
        	<INSTALL_DIR>\Openerp Server 6.1\Server\server\

        	- open a file called "openerp-server.conf" with your prefered text editor
        	(e.g. notepad), the "openerp-server.conf" live in:
        	<INSTALL_DIR>\Openerp Server 6.1\Server\server\openerp-server.conf

        	- at the end of the file, add the following line:
        	fonts_search_path = <INSTALL_DIR>\Openerp Server 6.1\Server\server\fonts
        	<blockqoute>Dont forget to replace <INSTALL_DIR> with the absolute path of OpenERP server installation (e.g. C:\Program Files).</blockqoute>

        	- go to DjaVu Fonts Site http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Download and download a file called dejavu-fonts-ttf-2.33.tar.bz2 here is another mirror for it:
        	http://ie.archive.ubuntu.com/ftp.frugalware.org/pub/frugalware/frugalware-current/source/x11/dejavu-ttf/dejavu-fonts-ttf-2.33.tar.bz2

        	- extract "dejavu-fonts-ttf-2.33.tar.bz2" and copy the contents of "ttf" folder into your fonts directory:
        	<INSTALL_DIR>\Openerp Server 6.1\Server\server\fonts

        - Now, restart openerp server:
        	-- Control Panel => Administrative Tools => Services
        	-- find a service called openerp server
        	-- restart it.

    Installation on Linux:
    ----------------------
    	Because There are several ways to install OpenERP on Linux, Files Locations are not unique. so, this instructions assume that you install OpenERP using the popular method, Through apt-get on ubuntu platform.

    	1- Copy the file "textobject.py" into:
			/usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/reportlab/pdfgen/textobject.py
		make sure you backup old "textobject.py" before you replace it.

		2- Check to ensure if the link file:
			/usr/share/pyshared/reportlab/pdfgen/textobject.py
		pointing correctly to the new "textobject.py" file.

		3- Copy "arabic_reshaper.py" file, and "bidi" directory into:
			/usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/

		4- Create a folder called "fonts" in a location that is accessable by openerp server. (e.g. /usr/share/pyshared/fonts).

		5- go to DejaVu Fonts Site, from http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Download and download a file called dejavu-fonts-ttf-2.33.tar.bz2 here is another mirror for it:
        	http://ie.archive.ubuntu.com/ftp.frugalware.org/pub/frugalware/frugalware-current/source/x11/dejavu-ttf/dejavu-fonts-ttf-2.33.tar.bz2

        6- extract "dejavu-fonts-ttf-2.33.tar.bz2" copy the contents of a folder called "ttf" and paste them into "fonts" directory you created on step 4.

        7- use linux searching tool, search for a file called "openerp-server.conf", open it with a text editor (e.g. gedit), at the end of it, paste the following line:
        	fonts_search_path = /usr/share/pyshared/fonts
        where "/usr/share/pyshared/fonts" is your new fonts directory you created on step 4.

        8- restart openerp server, "sudo service openerp restart" go and try printing some reports with arabic characters.


	Using Fancy Fonts for your reports:
	-----------------------------------
		as you might noticed, using dejavu fonts are so uguly on arabic characters.
	there is a set of awesome arabic fonts (open source) created by arabeyes:
	http://projects.arabeyes.org/project.php?proj=Khotot
	go and download them.

	Changing Report Font Strategy:
	------------------------------
		you must know that openerp report engine depends on 4 standard fonts:
			1- Helvetica
			2- Times
			3- Times-Roman
			4- Courier

		all 4 fonts unable to render most languages correctly. as a result, openerp report enginge will automagically pickup DjaVu Fonts Set, when you point to it.
		That's why you set "fonts_search_path = /your/custom/fonts" option on openerp-server.conf file before. here is the mapping that openerp report engine does:

		 Font Name     |     Font Type   |        DjaVu Equivelant
		===================================================================
		 Helvetica          normal			   DejaVuSans.ttf
		 Helvetica          bold			   DejaVuSans-Bold.ttf
		 Helvetica          italic			   DejaVuSans-Oblique.ttf
		 Helvetica          bolditalic		   DejaVuSans-BoldOblique.ttf
		------------------------------------------------------------------- 
		 Times          normal			   LiberationSerif-Regular.ttf
		 Times          bold			   LiberationSerif-Bold.ttf
		 Times          italic			   LiberationSerif-Italic.ttf
		 Times          bolditalic		   LiberationSerif-BoldItalic.ttf
		------------------------------------------------------------------- 
		 Times-Roman    normal			   LiberationSerif-Regular.ttf
		 Times-Roman    bold			   LiberationSerif-Bold.ttf
		 Times-Roman    italic			   LiberationSerif-Italic.ttf
		 Times-Roman    bolditalic		   LiberationSerif-BoldItalic.ttf
		-------------------------------------------------------------------
		 Courier        normal				FreeMono.ttf
		 Courier        bold				FreeMonoBold.ttf
		 Courier        italic				FreeMonoOblique.ttf
		 Courier        bolditalic			FreeMonoBoldOblique.ttf


		 So, for example. if you want to replace Helvetica with something else, (e.g. ae_AlMohanad.ttf from arab eyes package), you can do it by renaming your font 
		 "DejaVuSans.ttf" and put it in your custom fonts directory.
